# Tower Defense Game

A simple Tower Defense made in Unity in just 2 days (over a weekend).  
It’s not perfect—I know the naming, formatting, and some parts could be better—but I had to work fast and was pretty tired!

## How to Run

Just open and run the **Bootstrap** scene. It loads everything else automatically.

## Changing Game Data

All game data (towers, enemies, levels) are stored as ScriptableObject assets.  
Just find the ScriptableObject in the project, tweak values in the Inspector, and run the Bootstrap scene again.

- Event system and Service Locator for communication  
- State pattern to control game flow  
- Object pooling for better performance  
- ScriptableObjects for data-driven design  
and ...

Feel free to check out the code! I built it quickly to show I know good architecture, even if it’s not 100% polished.
